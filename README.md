# Implementation-of-K-Means-Clustering-for-Customer-Segmentation

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the K Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import the necessary libraries(Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib,scikit-learn).
2. Load the customer dataset and select relevant features(eg.Annual Income and Spending Score).
3. Visualize the data using a scatter plot.
4. Choose the number of clusters (k) and apply the K-Means algorithms.
5. Fit the model and predict the cluster for each data point
6. Plot the clustered data with different colors and mark the cluster centers.
7. Draw minimum enclosing circles around each cluster to visualize spread. 

## Program and Output:

Program to implement the K Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation.
